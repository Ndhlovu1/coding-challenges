# QuickSort Algorithm
""" 
A sorting algorithm that uses DIVIDE & CONQUER methodology.

--CASE
    Given an array of items, a place is determined on the array on which to split and this is called the pivot point.
    All values GREATER than this point go to the RIGHT
    All values LESS than this point go to the LEFT - THESE 2 STEPS WILL LEAD TO TWO ARRAYS
    -
    The above process is applied to the arrays until there are no more elements left to sort
